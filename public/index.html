                    <p>
                      At RMCTC, SkillsUSA is more than just an organization;
                      it's a cornerstone of our educational approach. As a
                      chapter with students from all program areas, we embody
                      the spirit of SkillsUSA through our commitment to personal
                      development, workplace skills, and technical excellence.

                    <p>
                      Through the Framework, SkillsUSA students hone their
                      hands-on skills against current industry standards in more
                      than 130 occupational areas, from 3-D Animation to Welding
                      and nearly everything in between. At the same time, they
                      develop the transformative career-readiness skills —
                      teamwork, communication, professionalism, leadership and
                      more — that fuel career and life success.

                      learning, co-op opportunities, internships, or community
                      service, we strive to equip our students with the skills
                      they need to succeed in their careers from day one.

                      students and staff to our partnerships with industry
                      leaders.
